YouDroppedThis
============

Simple minecraft mod that adds sound effects for when items are dropped.
It can be set so any unspecified item plays a sound, specific items play specific noises, or both.
For specific noises per item the format is " itemname;soundevent ".
Sounds when items hit the ground is currently unimplemented but coming.
Everything can be set in config/ydt.cfg
